**Meeting notes from Zoom call at 9am GMT 22nd March 2024. Second meeting at 3pm is further down**

Present:
Zam Iqbal, Martin Hunt, Boas van der Putten, Jane Hawkey, Laura Carroll, Liz Batty, George Bouras, Gerry Tonkin-

JaneH and Dan Anderson - will split running of AMRFinder+ 
Laura Carroll - already running BGC from GECCO. plus GTDB Bacillus_A BTyper A
Gerry volunteers E coli ST

Jane suggests use pathogen.watch MLST (they have a docker container, Martin will heklp turning it into singularity)

George Bouras will do prophage annotation, needs to wait for bakta, then some harmonising so consistent with bakta.
I've pointed him at Wendy Figueroa and Daniel Cazares to combine forces.

Boas will have a think about Strep pyogenes

Matthew Croxen has offered to run any of

Streptococcus pneumoniae Pneumokitty, Streptococcus agalactiae GBS-SBG, Streptococcus pyogenes Emmtyper, Haemophilus influenzae Hicap, Escherichia coli Ec_typer, Shigella spp. Shigatyper
[Jane Hawkey says there is a more recent tool from FX], Bordetella pertussis/parapertussis BPAgST, Salmonella enterica SISTR, Neisseria gonorrhoea NG MAST, NG STAR, Klebsiella pneumoniae (lots of "complex species here so may wish to go to genus to cast a broader net) Kleborate, Listeria monocytogenes Lissero, Neisseria meningitidis meningotype, Legionella pneumophila Legsta

ZAM FORGOT to mention Lesley Hoyles (Klebsiella oxytoca-related genomes (grimontii, michiganensis, pasteurii, oxytoca), and Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Klebsiella planticola) and 
and Jonathan Thomas (Staphylococcus epidermidis and/or other coagulase-negative/non-aureus staphylococci)

Slightly rambling discussion about ways to
a) coordinate who is doing what/what is being done for each species
b) Gerry had an idea of allowing people to do their own typing of things and publish their results (eg on their own github) but have that centrally "advertised"/linked on an AllTheBacteria website.

Last year Nabil had plans to use a github mod/thing called Zen for project management, will see if he still has energy for this.
Generally people happy with Oliver Schwengers suggestion of a directory structure constructed from sample id, with species/tool/taxid injected in there perhaps.


**Meeting notes from Zoom call at 1500 GMT 22nd March 2024.**

Present: Finlay Macguire, Maria Luisa Andreani, Martin Hunt, Robert Petit, Nabil-Fareed Alikhan

Finlay would like to talk to Adrian Cazares about plasmid contig identification
Finlay would also like to use this data for a wider AMR database harmonisation project
Rob Petit will happily test the mof-search and convert to nextflow
