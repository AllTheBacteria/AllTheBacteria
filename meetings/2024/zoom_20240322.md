**Meeting notes from Zoom call at 9am GMT 22nd March 2024. Second meeting at 3pm is further down**

Present:
Zam Iqbal, Martin Hunt, Boas van der Putten, Jane Hawkey, Laura Carroll, Liz Batty, George Bouras, Gerry Tonkin-

JaneH and Dan Anderson - will split running of AMRFinder+ 
Laura Carroll - already running BGC from GECCO. plus GTDB Bacillus_A BTyper A
Gerry volunteers E coli ST

Jane suggests use pathogen.watch MLST (they have a docker container, Martin will heklp turning it into singularity)

George Bouras will do prophage annotation, needs to wait for bakta, then some harmonising so consistent with bakta.
I've pointed him at Wendy Figueroa and Daniel Cazares to combine forces.

Boas will have a think about Strep pyogenes

Slightly rambling discussion about ways to
a) coordinate who is doing what/what is being done for each species
b) Gerry had an idea of allowing people to do their own typing of things and publish their results (eg on their own github) but have that centrally "advertised"/linked on an AllTheBacteria website.

Last year Nabil had plans to use a github mod/thing called Zen for project management, will see if he still has energy for this.
