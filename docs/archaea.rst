Archaea
=======

In addition to bacteria, we have processed archaea samples through the
assembly pipeline and run checkm2. Metadata was downloaded from the ENA
on 2024-07-31, getting all samples belonging to the taxon node 2157.
There were 818 samples with WGS Illumina paired sequencing (ie the
same rules we use for bacteria samples), resulting in 815 successful
assemblies. These constitute archaea release 2024-07.

The archaea files on OSF have the same format as for bacteria. The files
are here: https://osf.io/nehtp/. The only exception is that, because there
are relatively few samples, each release of assemblies consists of a
single tarball of FASTA files (as opposed to 100s of tarballs).

For a description of the files and metadata etc, please read the
:doc:`Assemblies </assemblies>` and :doc:`batch downloading </osf_downloads>`
pages.
