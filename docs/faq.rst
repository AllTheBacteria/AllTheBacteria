Can I freely use the data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyone/everyone is welcome to use the data and publish
with them. There is no expectation that the people who made the
release/data should be co-authors on these publications, but we would
appreciate citation of the preprint
(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.08.584059v1).


How can I get involved?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All are welcome. Contact us via Github, Slack or the monthly zoom calls.
Anyone who contributes to the project, through analysis, project management or
any other means, ought to be an author of the paper.


What happens if two people want to run their competing methods?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Bad example, prokka versus bakta or one AMR tool versus another).
First, anyone can do anything they like, but to get into the releases,
we should discuss on a zoom call and make a decision.
We shall tend towards allowing multiple analyses (eg we intend to run bakta
on everything but if someone wants to run prokka too, we should we ok to add
that to the release too). However, if it starts to get silly with people
wanting 4 tools each run with 3 parameters, then I think we get a lot
stricter - this compute isn't free (in terms of carbon, or money), so we'll
make a decision and do something limited.
